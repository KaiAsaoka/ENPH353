To get done: 

Line following: 
-Read imitation learning paper
-Processing image for clear lines
-> filters/masks
-etc


Sign Detection:
-Think about SIFT for recognizing logo
-CollectionTraining Data for CNN character recognition
    -Drop him on a sign and have him spin around front half
    -> Mix this data with regular activities data 
    -> Create seperate launch file for collecting data?

-Setup Collab
    -Label data
    -Histogram
    -Confusion Mtx

Pedestrian Detection:
-Hope imitation learning covers
-> Q learn

Misc: 
-Project Structure (what goes where)
-Implementing CNN/Qlearn into python script
-debugging screen, what do we want on there and how?
-Learn how github works
